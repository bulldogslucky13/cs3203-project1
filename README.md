Learning a language is an extraordinarily time consuming skill to learn. Even native-speakers of a language take years of development to be proficient in a language. We aim to solve the problem of learning languages right from the get go- the alphabet. The alphabet of any language is at the core of all communication. It is common that the first lesson in a new-language class will open with teaching of the alphabet. The letters which compose words is a crucial part to properly learning how to speak a new language.

The purpose of our product is to help outline for people where the alphabet of the language they intend to learn differs from the one they know first-hand. We believe learning this from the get-go will help reduce the total amount of time it takes for people to learn languages.
